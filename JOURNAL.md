## 10/20/2025 - 3D design and Electronic Choices  

Today, I have started choosing the electronics for this. I already have a lot of experience with combat robotics, though in the 1lb weight class. The electronics are similar, just larger and more expensive. I have always liked Repeat Robotics and their electronics, so I'm selecting most of my drive motor, DESC and weapon ESC from them. They are high-quality and reliable in combat. I settled on these electronics:
Drive Motor - Repeat Drive Pro
Weapon Motor - T-Motor AS2308 2600Kv
Battery - GNB 930mAh 4S 120C LiPo XT30
Drive Esc - Repeat AM32 Dual Brushless Drive ESC
Weapon Esc - Readytosky 45A blheli_s

The start of my 3D design was rough, laying out all the electronics in Fusion360 and making a plan. I knew it was going to be a vertical spinner with two motors and started CADing. Ten hours of hyper-fixation later, the first draft of my robot, Tranquillity, was done. I have a dual weapon motor, aluminum weapon panels, custom polyurethane wheels, a carbon fibre top and bottom plate and a carbon fibre drive plate for rigidity and weight.
