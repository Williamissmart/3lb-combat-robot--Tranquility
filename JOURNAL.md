## 10/20/2025 6 PM - 3D design and Electronic Choices  

Today, I have started choosing the electronics for this. I already have a lot of experience with combat robotics, though in the 1lb weight class. The electronics are similar, just larger and more expensive. I have always liked Repeat Robotics and their electronics, so I'm selecting most of my drive motor, DESC and weapon ESC from them. They are high-quality and reliable in combat. I settled on these electronics:
Drive Motor - Repeat Drive Pro
Weapon Motor - T-Motor AS2308 2600Kv
Battery - GNB 930mAh 4S 120C LiPo XT30
Drive Esc - Repeat AM32 Dual Brushless Drive ESC
Weapon Esc - Readytosky 45A blheli_s

The start of my 3D design was rough, laying out all the electronics in Fusion360 and making a plan. I knew it was going to be a vertical spinner with two motors and started CADing. Ten hours of hyper-fixation later, the first draft of my robot, Tranquillity, was done. I have a dual weapon motor, aluminum weapon panels, custom polyurethane wheels, a carbon fibre top and bottom plate and a carbon fibre drive plate for rigidity and weight.

## 10/20/2025 10 PM - 1.6mm Titanium Wedge  

![C4F0D2D3-BE0B-446D-9C22-BAA367159159.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkwOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb9b04aee3e73e492f2a3330a8bbf6cf219006ac/C4F0D2D3-BE0B-446D-9C22-BAA367159159.png)

After being obliterated in the 1lb class by horizontal spinners, I have invested in a 1.6mm titanium wedge to counter those pesky horizontal spinners. The point of a wedge is to deflect an impact from the horizontal spinner, then hit it with my vertical spinner, which means it is meant to be shot and destroyed. Titanium might not seem like an obvious choice when considering armour, as it's not as strong as steel or as light as magnesium or aluminum, but landing on this material required some thought. Titanium is light and fairly strong, which strikes a careful balance, optimizing weight and durability. 

To save weight, I decided to remove the center part connecting the two wedges, so instead of one large piece, it will be two separate pieces, partly inspired by Chain Saw Kitty's wedge. When asking seasoned builders about the effectiveness of this design, as long as the inside edge of the wedge is bent inwards, it should serve the same purpose.

At first, the holes were too close to the bend line, which, when bending this in practice, would bend from the hole line instead of the intended line. This was also pointed out, which might have saved me a lot of headache and trouble when bending.

The mounting system of the wedge is also intricate, while robust. It has a larger slope compared to the fork configuration, since the more angled it is, the less force is absorbed while having more material behind, since it's on an angle.

Modelling a sheet metal for the first time was extremely difficult, not knowing the angles for the bends and the geometry of the wedge to sit flush with the ground. This took a lot of trial and error, taking way longer than I expected. 

A wedge also increased the weight, which now exceeded the 3lb weight limit by ~70g, so I will have to figure out where to save and relocate this weight.  

## 10/21/2025 - Stress Simulation of Weapon Panel and Adjustments  

After asking for feedback on the aluminum weapon panel, I have told most of the force of a hit will be going downwards, instead of horizontal to the ground. This mean the main vertical struct is too thin to withstand huge hits and the material supporting the weapon horizontally is just a huge waste of weight.

These were the suggestions from seasoned builders, and after running some simulations, the recommended solutions performed 46% better at impact resistance. The Fusion 360 simulations took a long time to learn and analyze on my decently specced PC. But the data collected was extremely valuable.

Another problem pointed out to me was the position of my carbon fibre uprights. The point of these carbon fibre parts is supposed to help flip the robot in the case that the robot is flipped. They are attacked with 3 m3 screws with a locknut on the other end. So it turns out there wasn't enough space for these locknuts and the weapon pulley. After some deliberation, I moved the entire part downwards, giving it a unique look, and surprisingly good geometry for self-righting for such a large diameter weapon.

This is the revised version of the weapon system : ![Screenshot 2025-09-30 at 11.31.47 AM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDE1MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8f1356e29435a540334bc4d8cedd9a0572633f81/Screenshot%202025-09-30%20at%2011.31.47%E2%80%AFAM.png)

As you can see here, I have also made a weapon disk. They are not symmetrical, but they are perfectly balanced. I love art, and while working on robotics, I've come to appreciate the rounded corners and arcs. This weapon has a lot of bits and is optimized for a 2D geometry for MOI (moment of inertia).
